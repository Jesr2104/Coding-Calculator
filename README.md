# Coding-Calculator

This application is a powerful tool that I consider to be an essential part of my programming arsenal. I have decided to invest time and effort into developing it, in order to bring together a wide range of useful features and functionalities. By doing so, I aim to streamline my workflow and make it easier for me to perform common programming tasks. The application is intuitive, user-friendly and offers a comprehensive set of features that can help me to be more productive and efficient. With this application, I can save time and focus more on the logic and functionality of my application rather than getting stuck on repetitive tasks.

**This application is available for download on the Google Play Store.**

This is an application written for the android platform and is written in Kotlin with views designed in XML and an MVVM design pattern. The algorithm has been created in the application for each of the color systems that have been implemented.

## Future update.

I would spend in the future changing this application to a system of declarative views such as Jetpack Compose and of course changing and improving some more modern and renewed views. Also add some features that I think would enrich and help me further meet the goal of this app. Also another important issue would be to implement a much more robust architecture to facilitate future updates, for example using Clean architecture with MVVM.

- **Screen 1:** Shows the list of the main features of the application that are (Calculator, Converter, Number Systems, Color Harmony and Extras)
- **Screen 2:** These features are the calculator, it has the basic operations and also has a list with the last 15 results obtained with the option to load an old result into a new operation.
- **Screen 3:** This feature is a converter.
- **Screen 4:** Screen 3: this other feature is a converter of the most typical number systems used in the IT world (Binary Octal, Decimal, Hexadecimal)

## Color Harmony

| Color Scheme Type  | Definition |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| Complementary  | Uses colors opposite each other on the color wheel  |
| Split Complementary  | Uses a base color and the colors on either side of its complement |
| Analogous  | Uses colors next to each other on the color wheel  |
| Triadic  | Uses colors evenly spaced around the color wheel  |
| Tetradic | Uses four colors arranged into two complementary pairs  |

Many times you find yourself designing your new application and you need to choose a color or save the color that you like the most for future use or see which colors combine more harmonics with it, because this tool makes this task easier for you.

- **Screen 1:** It shows you the tool with all the information that it shows when you have selected a color, you can move the RGB bars to select a color or write a specific color in Hexadecimal or HSL, also a Picker the color to select a color in a circle of colors, At the bottom is the list of colors saved by the user.
- **Screen 2:** when you select a color from all those that appear on the screen, it shows you its information and its value in different color systems.
- **Screen 3:** This easy-to-explain tool is a color selector to make it easier to be specific with the color you're looking for.
- **Screen 4:** list of saved colors and their information.
- **Screen 5:** In this tool we have a color palette with the main tones so that you can select any of these and see all the tones from the lightest until the color becomes dark.
- **Screen 6:** In this last screen is how it would be displayed once you select a tone, the tones from the lightest and increasing their darkness.

## Extras Features

The extra features of the application are mainly focused on mathematical tools that can be very useful when you are programming and designing a new application and you need to calculate certain parameters.
